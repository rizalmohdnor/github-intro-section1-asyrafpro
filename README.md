## 🤓 Course Overview & Learning Outcomes

The goal of this course is to give you a brief introduction to GitHub. We’ll also provide you with materials for further learning and a few ideas to get you started on our platform. 🚀

## :octocat: Git and GitHub

Git is a **distributed Version Control System (VCS)**, which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing.  
With **Git**, you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if needed. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

GitHub is a platform that uses Git online with an easy-to-use interface. It's widely used across the software industry to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.

## :octocat: Understanding the GitHub Flow

The **GitHub flow** is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.

---

### 🗂️ **Repositories**

A **repository** is where your project work happens—think of it as your project folder.  
It contains all of your project’s files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.

---

### 💻 **Cloning**

When a repository is created on GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the ☁️. You can **clone** a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two.  
This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI.

---

### 📝 **Committing and Pushing**

- **Committing** and **pushing** are how you add changes made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub.
- You can make a **commit** when you’ve made changes to your project that you want to “checkpoint.”
- You can add a helpful **commit message** to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did.

## 💻 GitHub Terms to Know

### 🗂️ **Repositories**

We mentioned repositories already, but let’s dive deeper! Repositories help you organize your work. You can have many repositories, and your **GitHub dashboard** helps navigate between them.

Repositories often contain **READMEs**, which provide important information about the project.

---

### 🌿 **Branches**

You can use **branches** on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet.  
Typically, you create a new branch from the default branch (usually `main`). Once the changes are reviewed, you can merge them into the default branch.

---

### 🍴 **Forks**

A **fork** is a way to copy someone else’s repository and experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forking is popular for contributing to open source software!

---

### 🔄 **Pull Requests**

Pull requests are how you ask others for feedback on your work before merging it into the main branch.

---

### 🎯 **Issues**

**Issues** are a way to track tasks, bugs, or enhancements in your project.  
For larger projects, you can organize your issues using **GitHub Projects**.

---

## 👤 **Your User Profile**

Your **GitHub profile** is your personal space to showcase your contributions, repositories, and interactions with the community.  
You can also create a **profile README** to introduce yourself to others!

---

## 📝 **Using Markdown on GitHub**

You can use **Markdown** to style your files, pull requests, and issues. Markdown makes your content more readable and interactive by adding bold text, links, and images.

Learn more about using GitHub's markdown: [Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## 🌐 **Engaging with the GitHub Community**

The GitHub community is vast, from students to professional developers. Here are a few ways to engage:

- **Starring repositories** ⭐: If you find a repository interesting, star it!
- **Following users** 👥: Follow users to receive updates on their activity.
- **GitHub Explore** 🔍: Discover new projects, events, and developers.
